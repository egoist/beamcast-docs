Beamcast works on all Chromium-based browsers, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc. Download it on [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/beamcast/concemeahlknpdkflbogegklpcicofgj).

For Firefox, you can download it on [Firefox add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/beamcast/).

## Firefox

After installing the extension on Firefox, please pin the extension icon to the browser toolbar and right click the icon to select "Manage Extension", then click "Permissions" and give it the permission to access your data for all websites:

![set permissions](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/egoist-bot/images@main/uPic/IukbCY.png)

We need this in order to inject a script into the website you're visiting, so that we can show the popup panel when you select text.
