You can click the icon to manage all your AI commands and your account.

## Firefox

After installing the extension on Firefox, right click the extension icon to select "Manage Extension", then click "Permissions" and give it the permission to access your data for all websites:

We need this in order to inject a script into the website you're visiting, so that we can show the popup panel when you select text.
